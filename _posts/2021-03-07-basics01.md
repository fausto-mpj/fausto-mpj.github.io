### The Problem

So, for the inaugural post, I want to write about something uncontroversial. Joking. We're delving in a wild territory where the very fabric of society dissolves into nothingness: **matrix notation**. First, I'd like to fabricate a pretty innacurate statistic.

> 9 out of 10 books with any Maths in them employ an idiosyncratic matrix notation.

Given this (false) information and assuming that eventually we're going to mess with matrices, it seems reasonable enough to establish our ground rules and notation right off the bat. In order to do this, we're going to use *Linear Algebra and its Applications* (4th edition) by [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/). Let's do it.
