subtitle: Learning Math by mistakes and missteps
---

<div><p>This is a place to explore Mathematics by learning with our mistakes. My aim is to study different fields of Mathematics and share my experiences with you. However, I am not going to omit all the mess that happens between each theorem and its book-like proof. In every step I want you to see every single bit of bad ideas and mistakes in order to understand why something isn't the case. More importantly, I want you to know the answers to some of the &quot;why not?&quot; that happen in the process of doing Math.</p>
<p>Let us begin! This is <strong>Y Naught</strong>.</p>
