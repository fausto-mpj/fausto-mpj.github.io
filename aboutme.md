### A little bit about me on 2021

I’m a 33 years old Stats undergraduate student from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Before venturing into Mathematics, I stumbled upon a Bachelor Degree in Law and a Master of Arts in Philosophy of Law. So I’m a latecomer and have a lot of things to learn in order to compensate for all the time spent memorizing Latin aphorisms. *Tempus fugit*, it seems.
